        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            - How to connect to matrix system?
            
            ssh yourID@matrix.senecacollege.ca //and type your password

            - Any basic command that we usually used?
            ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, rm, rm -r, cat, mv, cp
            
        </code></pre>
        <p>Week 2 Materials: Basic Linux File system command</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            - More importantly, what kind of text editor should linux system used?
            vi or vim, nano

            - How to use vi or vim?
            vim a.txt //once this command is enter, you will enter into a vi control platform
            i         //press i to get into insert mode
            Esc       //press keyboard Esc to cancel and go back to vi control platform
            :x        //save and exit vim editor

            - How to use nano?
            nano a.txt //once this command is enter, you will enter into nano control platform, you are already into the insert mode
            abc        //type anything you want, in this example typed "abc"
            Ctrl+x     //press keyboard fast key "Ctrl + x " to save the document
            y          //press y (yes) because you want to save the modify File
            Enter      //press Enter because you want the original file name (a.txt), unless you want to save another name

        <p>Week 3 Materials: File Location Path</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            - Absolute path and Relative to home path does not care where you are (pwd), it will move to the exact address that you have typed.
            - Absolute path:
            /home/yourID/ABC
            
            - Relative to home path:
            ~/ABC

            
            - Relative path names use it usually, but you need to know where you are first (pwd)
            - Relative path (current directory):
            ./
            .

            - Relative path (parent directory):
            ../ABC
            ../
            ..

            - Relative path (move down to one directory):
            ./ABC
            ABC

        <p>Week 4 Materials: Permissions + data representation</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            4 Numeric types: Binary Decimal Octal Hexadecimal

            Binary:
            0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
            0+0+0+0+0+4+0+1
            = 5 (Decimal)

            Decimal:
            5

            Octal:
            0 0 0 1 0 1
            0+0+0+4+0+1
            = 5 (Decimal)

            Hexadecimal:
            5
            
            -File permission using chmod to change file permission (user,group,other)
            chmod 744 a.txt

            -Umask to control what kind of permission should it be given when creating a file or a directory
            umask 022

        <p>Week 5 Materials: Redirections</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            1 stdin, 2 stdout, 2 std error 

            1 + 2 + 2 = 5 redirection symbols in total

            stdin <:
            tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < a.txt
            - get the information from a.txt and process the command tr (change lower case to upper case in this case). The content of a.txt won't change

            stdout > >>:
            ls -l > a.txt
            - get the command result (ls -l) and overwrite it to a.txt. No output shown

            ls -l >> a.txt
            - get the command result (ls -l) and append it to a.txt. No output shown

            stderr 2> 2>>:
            PWD 2> a.txt
            - get the error command result (PWD) and overwrite it to a.txt. No output shown

            PWD 2>> a.txt
            - get the error command result (PWD) and append it to a.txt. No output shown


            Grep, Pipeline |, tee command

            Example ðŸ”°

            - Grep is similar to a find function (ctrl + F)
            
            grep '^who' a.txt

            - find all lines in a.txt, who has first three character 'who' at the beginning
            
            Example ðŸ”°

            - Pipeline is like a continue instruction and giving more guidance after the output

            ls -l | sort -r | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' | tee result.txt

            - 1. ls -l, show all the details inside this directory
            - 2. sort -r, sort all the line in reverse order from Z to a
            - 3. tr 'a-z' 'A-Z', change all lower case to upper case
            - 4. tee result.txt, after processing all 3 steps, save the final output to result.txt and print the output

            Example ðŸ”°

            - tee command, is like saving the output result into a text editor, moreover it will also print the output

            pwd | tee result.txt

            - 1. pwd, show your current location`
            - 4. tee result.txt, save the output (pwd) to result.txt and print the output
