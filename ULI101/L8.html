        <p>Nothing or anything in between .*</p>

        <p>The difference between grep & egrep are egrep knows the instruction in most of the special character. Where grep needs to specify as a instruction or a character</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            grep & egrep

            Example 🔰

            grep "n+B" a.txt
            - We are looking for the 3 characters exactly looks like "n+B"

            grep "n\+B" a.txt
            - In this case, we are looking for "n" characters that can be appear 1 or more times, and the following up chracter has to be "B"
            - Ex. nnnnnnnB, nnB, nB

            egrep "n+B" a.txt
            - egrep command doesn't need a "\" backslash to specify as a instruction (extended regular expression).
            - it works the same as grep "n\+B" a.txt

            egrep "n{1,}B" a.txt
            - the + sign is the same meaning as how many occurrence on previous character. + is equal to {1,}
            - the other sign ? is equal to {0,1}. Means it is zero or 1 occurrence of the previous character

            Questions:
            1. Print all the line of results
            2. Print all line result only provider is “Garden”
            3. Print the reverse result on Q2.
            4. Print all line result, only want the third character letter as “A” or “a”
            5. Print the reverse result on Q4. (use other method – Q2)
            6. Print all line result starts with letter F and G (upper and lower cases).
            7. Print all line result without “Fungi” and “giggi” (use grep or egrep) 
            8. Print all the line of results. (Bonus: print without those title – FruitName … Provider)
