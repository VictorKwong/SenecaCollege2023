        <h3>Linking Files - Hard Links VS Symbolic Links</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            Hard Links advantage:
            1. If one of the hard link file is delete, the other hard link files content will still remain there.
            2. If one of the hard link file is update, the other hard link files also update by itself.

            Hard Links disadvantage:
            1. Refer back to Hard Link advantage point 1, it will take a lot of space for each individual file. Ex. Each Hard Link File * Quantity, 10KB * 10 = 100KB in total
            2. Hard Links only works for its own Linux sever, it cannot do cross over other Linux server.
            
            Example ðŸ”°

            Hard Link (ln parameter1 parameter2)
            - parameter1 refers to original file that you want to do Hard Links
            - parameter2 refers to the copy of the original file that is Hard Links.
            
            ln a.txt hardlink.txt
            - a.txt is the original File
            - hardlink.txt is the copy file that is Hard Link with a.txt.
            - a.txt and hardlink.txt now shares the same content

            ln hardlink.txt anotherHardlink.txt
            - now all three files are Hard Link together, a.txt hardlink.txt anotherHardlink.txt

            echo "test" >> a.txt
            - append a.txt content and also updating the same content to hardlink.txt and anotherHardlink.txt (the power of Hard Link)

            rm -r a.txt
            - Even we delete the original file, the other two files hardlink.txt and anotherHardlink.txt are still Hard Link together, because they are still sharing the same i-node

            > ls -li //check their PID is the same, all Hard Link files are sharing the same i-node
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            Symbolic Links advantage:
            1. Treat it as a desktop shortcut, Symbolic Links will give direction that leads the original file location.
            2. Storage space is far more manageable than Hard Link because it contain way less storage space.

            Symbolic Links disadvantage:
            1. If you delete the Symbolic Link target original file, then the Symbolic Link will be broken.
            2. There will be no backups for the original file.

            
            Example ðŸ”°

            Symbolic Link (ln -s parameter1 parameter2)
            - parameter1 refers to original file that you want to do Symbolic Links
            - parameter2 refers to the a short cut create by parameter1.
            
            ln -s a.txt symbolicLink.txt
            - a.txt is the original File
            - symbolicLink.txt is the short cut file create by a.txt.
            - a.txt and symbolicLink.txt now shares the same content

            echo "test" >> a.txt
            - append a.txt content and also updating the same content to symbolicLink.txt (same logic as Hard Link)

            rm -r a.txt
            - If we delete the original file, the symbolicLink.txt file will be broken because it cannot find the original file location.
            - Note a.txt and symbolicLink.txt they did not share the same i-node

            > ls -li //check their PID is the same, all Symbolic Link files are NOT sharing the same i-node

        <h3>Managing Job Process</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            - Check process information:
            ps
            ps -u username
            ps -l
            ps -ef
            ps aux
            Top //ctrl + c, to quit the command
        
            - 5 Common Job Commands (fg %, bg%, kill %, kill -9 %, jobs)
            
            Example ðŸ”°

            - Create exercise:
            vim a (ctrl + z)
            vim b (ctrl + z)
            vim c (ctrl + z)
            vim d (ctrl + z)

            - create vim a,b,c and d, after that use key command (ctrl + z) and send the job command to stop list
            - Jobs list has 3 status: Front End, Stop List and Back End

            jobs //check all status job, it can be running, stop or killed
            - You might see there will be a "+" sign and a "-" sign after each job ID
            - "+" sign refers to the most recent job that you have worked with
            - "-" sign refers to the second most recent job that you have worked with
            
            fg %1 //go into the stop list, pull out job ID 1 and send it to the Front End. (ctrl + z) to send back to the stop list

            bg %2 //go into the stop list, pull out job ID 2 and send it to the Back End. (Usually works with Sleep command, the command will keep running at the background)

            kill -9 %1 //you want to terminate the job ID 1 and remove it from the job list. "kill -9" is a brute force way to terminate/kill the job ID
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Alias command</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            - Alias command works when you want to type the created name of the command, and it refers to the variable command that you had assigned to.

            Alias abc='pwd'
            - You have create the abc command and the command will work as "pwd", which means show where you at in this case

            abc
            /home/userID
            - now abc will refers to pwd since you have alias the pwd command to abc

            history
            - show the history of command you have typed, with command numbers as well. Ex. 5519 abc

            !5519
            - it will trigger typing back the abc command because our example shows history command number 5519 refers to abc. (Note each Linux system will have different history + command number)
